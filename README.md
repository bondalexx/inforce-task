Actual task
Need to build a product list web app. The goal is to simulate a shop app. There are two primary views: the product list view and the product view.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, using the Redux and Redux Toolkit template.

Configurations:
- In the folder when you want to handle a project write https://github.com/bondalexx/inforce-task.git
- Open folder in editor
- Open terminal and write in console cd ./inforce-task-client and wirte npm i
- Open new terminal and write in console cd ./db and wrtie npm install -g json-server

How to start a project:
- In inforce-task-client terminal write npm run dev
- In db terminal write json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

You can change the port for db file but then you should shange BASE_URL in configurations folder in inforce-task-client
